    <h1 class="title-font font-medium text-indigo-700 tracking-widest text-2xl mb-3">How to reach Delhi to Macleodganj
    </h1>

    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-800 -tracking-5">Depending on where you started from in Delhi, the total distance till
      Dharamshala and Mcleodganj can be slightly over 500 kilometers hence an early start is highly recommended. The
      good news, however, is that the road is mostly smooth all the way so the entire journey can easily be completed in
      10-11 hours. The only thing that can cause a further delay is if you got stuck in traffic around Dharamshala or
      Mcleodganj.<br>
      Find a hotel per your liking and check-in if you did not book one in advance. You can stay at either Dharamshala
      or Mcleodganj as both of the places are equally good. My advice would be to stay at Mcleodganj because it gives
      you better sightseeing access. Whether or not to book a hotel in advance is entirely your preference.
      My recommendation would be to book your stay.<br> Sometimes both Dharamshala and Mcleodganj can get a bit crowded,
      especially over long weekends; which means that you may have to run around a bit finding a hotel with a vacancy.
      Hence better would be to search a bit online and book a hotel per your preference and budget.

    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-800 -tracking-5">Looking to take your team away on a retreat to enjoy awesome food and
      take in some sunshine? We have a list of places to do just that.
      In my last few articles, I talked in detail about a trip to Dharamshala and Mcleodganj separately; covering
      details like how to reach, where to stay, and tourist attractions that a person should visit. I also wrote a
      couple of other articles providing information on monasteries in the area, trekking destinations like Triund and
      Snowline, and other nearby villages like Dharamkot. In this particular post, I will put all of this information
      together and talk about how you can plan your Dharamshala Mcleodganj Trip over a period of 4 – 5 days covering all
      of these places.

      I will draft a sample itinerary and then run it down providing a day by day breakup of sightseeing and other
      activities. Hopefully, after reading this article, you will have a fair enough idea of how you can plan your trip
      in the best possible manner.

      I said 4 to 5 days because in my opinion that is a minimum period of time a person should dedicate to visiting
      Dharamshala and Mcleodganj. There are is a lot of things to do in this area and with at least 5 days in hand, you
      will be able to explore and enjoy your trip. Any less than this and it will just be a ‘Touch & Go’ kind of a deal.
      With that being said, if you were living in close vicinity like Pathankot or Chandigarh, you can also do a trip in
      3 days as well.

    <h1 class="title-font font-medium text-indigo-700 tracking-widest text-2xl mt-3">Macleodganj to Triund</h1>

    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-800 -tracking-5">You will trek down to Mcleodganj today the same way that you came but
      will be covering two more places before reaching back to your hotel. A little ahead of Triund Top is the snowline
      cafe which gives stunning views of Dhauladhar Range and Indrahar Pass. This is where you will be headed before
      trekking back down to Mcleodganj. I highly recommend visiting this spot along with Triund Top.

      Get up early and ensure that you are on your way to Snowline Cafe by 7 AM. It will take you about two hours to get
      there. Reach the cafe, have something to eat, enjoy the view, click tons of pictures, and head back to Triund Top.
      Depending on the pace you were walking at, you should be able to get back to Triund from snowline before 12 noon.

      Now it is time to head back to Mcleodganj. Get something to eat first at any of the dhabas at Triund Top and start
      trekking down. It will take you no more than 2 hours to reach back Gallu Devi Temple because walking back down is
      easier than climbing up. Right at the spot where the Triund trail starts, there is another trail that goes towards
      Gallu Waterfall and you will be covering that too before reaching back at your hotel.
    </p>

    <h1 class="title-font font-medium text-indigo-700 tracking-widest text-2xl mt-8">Gallu Waterfall</h1>

    <img class="object-cover object-center w-full h-80 mt-8" src="./img/water.jpg" alt="stats">
    <p class="mt-2 text-slate-800 -tracking-5">The broader trail on your right leads to Triund, while a narrower trail
      to your left leads to the Waterfall. There is also a pipeline here that you can follow as your guide. After a walk
      of about 2 kilometers, this trail will take you to the amazing Gallu Waterfall which unlike Bhagsu Waterfall is
      not at all crowded. There is hardly anyone around and it is a good spot to take a dip in the waterfall. There is
      also a cafe near the waterfall where you can get something to eat.

      Relax at the waterfall but keep a track of the time. Return to Gallu Devi Temple again; find a ride to take you
      back to Mcleodganj at your hotel. Freshen up and step out to have dinner and spend your last evening in
      Mcleodganj.
